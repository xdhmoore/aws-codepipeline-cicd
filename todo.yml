todo:
  - turn off anti-dangling comma rule
  - turn off autoformatting
  - make semicolons acceptable
  - change repo connections to use main instead of master
  - clean up and remove makefile
  - setup instructions:
    - add code start setup
    - add dockerhub pullthrough cache credentials setup
  - separate into more easily used constructs
  - get rid of main stack
  - fix BuildUPortalJava cache, which isn't caching as expected:
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-caching.html
    - I see some info which indicates this can be done by using a lower level
      CodeBuildAction instead of a CodeBuildStep, but the api is different. In
      a number of places it's non-trivial
    - It should only build if uportal-start has a new commit, or maybe if
      uportal or portlet binaries have changed.
  - figure out if ecrPolicy has the right resources. Currently has repo and
    images for all permissions

  - move /library prefix into the uPortal docker file itself
  - try docker layer caching
  - set version tags on docker images
  - in uportal-start change name of mirrorPrefix variable to be registryPrefix
  - remove any extra dockerFile args i made and am not using
  - clean up pipeline-stacks into creator functions and/or separate components
